## Multi-threaded replication

_Status: not fixed as of MOCO v0.9.5_

If you use MOCO with MySQL version 8.0.25 or earlier, you should not configure the replicas with `replica_parallel_workers` > 1.
Multi-threaded replication will cause the replica to fail to resume after the crash.

This issue is registered as [#322](https://github.com/cybozu-go/moco/issues/322) and will be addressed at no distant date.
